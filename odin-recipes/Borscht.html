        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil or vegetable oil, divided</li>
            <li>1 (1 1/4 pound) section bone-in beef shank with a lot of meat, or 1 pound beef stew meat, excess fat trimmed</li>
            <li>1 large onion, chopped (about 1 1/2 cups)</li>
            <li>8 cups beef broth or beef stock, divided</li>
            <li>4 large beets (about 1 1/2 pounds), peeled and chopped</li>
            <li>4 carrots (1 pound), peeled and chopped</li>
            <li>2 cups thinly sliced cabbage</li>
            <li>3/4 cup chopped fresh dill, divided</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p><h3>Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).<h3></p></li>
                <p>Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a large, thick-bottomed pot on medium high heat. Add the shank slice or stew beef. Let the beef brown lightly on one side, then turn over.</p>
                <p>Add the chopped onions to the pot. Let the onions cook and soften, about 5 minutes.</p>
            <li><p><h3>Add 4 cups broth and simmer until the beef is tender:</h3></p></li>
                <p>Pour 4 cups of the beef broth over the beef and onions in the pot. Bring to a boil. Lower the heat to a simmer. Cover and cook until the meat is falling-off-the-bone tender, about 1 hour and 30 minutes.</p>
            <li><h3>Preheat the oven to 400°F.</h3></li>
            <li><p><h3>Meanwhile, prep and roast the root vegetables:</h3></p></li>
                <p>Peel and chop the beets, carrots, and potatoes into 1/2-inch pieces. Toss the beets and carrots with a teaspoon or two of olive oil and spread them out in a single layer on a foil lined roasting pan. Roast in preheated oven for 15 minutes.</p>
            <li><p><h3>Remove the meat from the pot:</h3></p></li>
                <p>Once the beef has cooked through until tender, remove from the pot, and take the pot off the heat. If you are using a beef shank, remove and discard any bone, connective tissue, and excess fat. Chop the meat into bite sized pieces.</p>
            <li><p><h3>Skim the soup:</h3></p></li>
                <p>Skim off any excess fat from the liquid in the pot.</p>
            <li><p><h3>Finish cooking the soup:</h3></p></li>
                <p>Return the pot to the stove and add the remaining broth, the carrots, beets, and potato. Add the chopped meat to the pot, the sliced cabbage, and a half cup of the fresh dill. Bring to a simmer, and cook for another 15 minutes or so, until the cabbage is cooked through.</p>
